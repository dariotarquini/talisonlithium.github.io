								<span class="image main"><img src="images/greenbushes.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Talison Lithium's lithium mining and processing operation is located directly south and adjacent to the town of Greenbushes in Western Australia. It is approximately 250 kilometres south of Perth and Fremantle, a major container shipping port, and 90 kilometres south east of the port of Bunbury, a major bulk handling port, in the south-west of Western Australia.

									Mining, timber milling, faming and tourism form the backbone of the industry in the South West.
									
									The attractive location of the Lithium operations, both in proximity to Perth and the coastal holiday regions of the South West Western Australia, enables us to recruit and retain a talented and stable workforce who generally live in the local area.</p>
								<p><h2 class="major">Why Lithium?</h2></p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/lithium.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Despite having an environmental cost, lithium mining is a necessary process to allow for a clean energy transition and for the economic development of a region. Lithium is a key material in electrical energy storage applications such as electric vehicles and large-scale grid battery storage. 

									A mining project of this scale can bring great economic opportunities to the local community however it must be understood that the size and culture of the township will likely change. </p>

								<h2 class="major">Indigenous Peoples</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/noongar.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Indigenous peoples are critical partners and stakeholders for BHP.

									Many of our operated assets are located on or near lands traditionally owned by or under the customary use of Indigenous peoples. We aim to recognise and respect the rights of Indigenous peoples and embrace the opportunity to establish respectful, long-lasting relationships through which we seek meaningful engagement, trust and mutual benefit.
									
									We understand Indigenous peoples often have profound and special connections to and identification with lands and waters, and these are tied to their physical, spiritual, cultural and economic wellbeing. We also understand Indigenous peoples in many regions of the world have been historically disadvantaged and often still experience various forms of social exclusion.
									
									We recognise our activities impact on Indigenous peoples and we are committed to working together to ensure we are an enabling partner with Indigenous peoples and that we positively contribute to the realisation of the rights of Indigenous peoples.</p>
									<h2 class="major">Greenbushes Communities</h2>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/gbcommunity.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>We endeavour to treat all stakeholders with respect and build trust through open and honest relationships. This helps us achieve a clear understanding of the context and impacts of our activities and informs how we can make a meaningful contribution to economic and social development.</p>
									<p>Talison Lithium understands that we all have a role to play in understanding and managing social and human rights impacts, and building resilience through all phases of an operated asset's life cycle. Our approach has been developed based on standards from the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM), the United Nations (UN) Global Compact, the International Petroleum Industry Environmental Conservation Association (IPIECA) and frameworks such as the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the International Finance Corporation (IFC) Performance Standards.</p>
									<p><h4 class="major">Community relationship:</h4>First and foremost, we respect the authority of the Shire of Bridgeton council, and we pledge to maintain honest communication with governments whilst complying with all applicable regulations. Hence moving forward, we will collaborate closely with the Shire of Bridgeton and structure our operations to local suppliers to support local businesses.  Moreover, we will devote funding to local infrastructure such as schools and health care facilities, and additionally contribute to the local community groups such as sports and conservation programs. Facilitating local traineeships and providing employment opportunities is also a high priority for us in our mission to give back to the community and foster meaningful engagement.  
										(As stated above we will direct our efforts to the Indigenous community as well).</p>
									<p><h4 class="major">Crisis management:</h4>By acknowledging the safety and health risks that may be involved, our organization is committed to undertaking regular risk-based due diligence checks throughout all stages of the project and identifying high risk areas. We will then establish a management system based off risk controls and develop an emergency response plan to protect our communities, workers and natural environment (ICMM, n.d.) </p>
									<p><h4 class="major">Safety and health:</h4>As we recognize that our miners may be exposed to occupational health risks such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, our aim is to ensure effective management to reduce harmful excretions within the local water sources, and consciously minimize noise and dust pollution. Additionally, we will implement a workplace health and safety education program and this will have the opportunity to be extended to contractors and the local community.</p>
									<p><h4 class="major">Preventing child and forced labour:</h4> We do not condone child and forced labour but we are aware that it is still prevalent in many regions. Therefore, to ensure ethical conduct, by no means will we employ a child under 18 years to engage in work or be present on the mining site. Secondly, we are in partnership with various recruitment agencies and have processes in place to avoid unreasonable limitations on employee's freedom of movement within the workplace and to eradicate any possibility of forced labour within our workplace (The Mining Association of Canada 2018).</p>

							<article id="about">
								<h2 class="major">Mission</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/juukan.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>The destruction of ancient Indigenous sites like the Juukan caves, described as home to the "dawning of humanity", to allow a mine expansion is a devastating story â€” but it's not a new one for Western Australia..</p>
								<p>The laws, policies and power imbalances that allowed the blast to happen remain largely unchanged. This is undermining the communities' general trust in mining companies. We, at Talison Lithium, intend to develop a portfolio of engagement activities to enhance the company reputation with the local communities and strenghten our social licence to operate. </p>
